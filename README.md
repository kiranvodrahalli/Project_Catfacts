Project_Catfacts
================

a very trollish python script to send emails to people about catfacts, works like a cron job. 
Scrapes a website (one with cat facts) for message content. Run "python catfacts.py" in terminal
in order to use. Fill out usr_options.txt as specified in order for it to work.
